## Tech Used
- Amazon S3
- AWS Glue
- Amazon Athena
- Tableau (visuals only, no workbook)
- VS Code
- GitHub

## What I Did

### 1. Data Upload (Amazon S3)
- Uploaded Online Food dataset to S3.

### 2. Data Cleaning (AWS Glue)
- Used Glue crawler to detect schema.
- Removed unnecessary column (col12).
- Updated schema for consistency.

### 3. Analysis (Amazon Athena)
Queries performed:
- Age > 20 analysis
- Feedback: positive vs negative
- Gender-based trends
- Location-based ordering patterns
- Occupation-based analysis
- Age-group comparison

### 4. Visualization (Tableau)
Created charts (screenshots provided):
- Feedback analysis
- Age group comparison
- Gender trends
- Occupational differentiation

> Tableau workbook is not included (project visualized locally). Screenshots of the charts are included instead.
